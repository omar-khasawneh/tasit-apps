# Tasit example wallet

An example wallet that demonstrates what we can achieve with deep linking between a Tasit single-purpose native mobile dapp and a wallet app.

The [`Decentraland by Tasit`](../decentraland) app deep links into this wallet using the `tasit-wallet` scheme with URLs like this:

`tasit-wallet://transaction?amount=10&to=0xa14c...&from=0xa14c...`.
