# Tasit CLI

This folder is the eventual home for the Tasit CLI.

For now, we're buliding out the scaffolding of our first app in the [`decentraland` directory](../decentraland). The CLI will use the repeatable parts of the scaffolding there to autogenerate a bare bones mobile Ethereum dapp or a more fully featured one, for example one prebuilt specifically for NFT dapps.

There's more info in the [main README for this repo](../README.md)
