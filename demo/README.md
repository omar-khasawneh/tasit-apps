### Tasit Demo

This folder is the eventual home for the Tasit Demo app.

For now, the best demo of the Tasit SDK's capabilities can be found in the [`decentraland`](../decentraland) folder. The Decentraland app is also serving as our first demo app for using the Tasit SDK.

It's an app that shows off how easy it is to build a standalone native mobile app for Ethereum NFTs using the Tasit SDK. The app is built using React Native, Expo, React Navigation, Prettier, Babel, and the Tasit SDK.
