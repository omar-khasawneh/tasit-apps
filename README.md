### Tasit account example

A minimal TypeScript + Expo app demonstrating using `@tasit/account` via `@tasit/hooks`

[`account-example`](./apps/account-example)

The Tasit account example app shows off how easy it is to build a standalone native mobile app for Ethereum using [Tasit](https://github.com/tasitlabs/tasit-sdk).

The app is built using React Native, Expo, [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/), Prettier, TypeScript, and Tasit.

### What is Tasit?

The Tasit demo apps are a suite of native mobile apps for mainstream users that lets them use popular Ethereum dapps as easily as their other favorite apps without needing to know the technical detail that Ethereum is involved.

Unlike with dapp browsers where you use multiple dapps as mobile web apps from within one app, you can use each of the Tasit dapps via its own standalone native mobile app.

This entails a different, simpler onboarding flow in an environment without MetaMask. The user is in control of their private keys, but much of this happens "automagically" behind the scenes.

The Tasit apps are built with [Tasit](https://github.com/tasitlabs/tasit-sdk), a JavaScript / TypeScript SDK that lets developers create their own native Ethereum dapps.

_Disclaimer:_ The alpha versions of these apps are under active development. We encourage you to try them out or use them as a reference for hackathons, etc., but they're not ready for anything involving real funds on mainnet. If you'd prefer to wait for a more battle-tested release, please watch this repo with the `Releases only` setting and/or sign up to be notified about our releases on the [tasit.io](https://tasit.io) website.

### Developers

This is a monorepo for all of the open-source Tasit 3rd-party mobile apps for Ethereum dapps.

These apps all use [Tasit](https://github.com/tasitlabs/tasit-sdk).

##### Running an app from this repo locally

```
git clone https://github.com/tasitlabs/tasit-apps.git
cd tasit-apps
cd demo
npm install
npm start
```

### Decentraland Market powered by Tasit

[Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/) is a dapp using [unique tokens / NFTs](http://erc721.org/). `Decentraland Market` lets you use the marketplace for Decentraland as a dapp on mobile.

This app also shows off the major functionality of [Tasit](https://github.com/tasitlabs/tasit-sdk).

We're building the "Decentraland Market by Tasit" app in the [`decentraland` dir](./apps/decentraland).
